## What is WriteNoise?

WriteNoise is a sound to image converter. How can we convert a sound to an image? Well, we convert every bit of sound into the bits of an RGBA value. Each RGBA value then becomes a pixel in the final image.

## WHy would you use WriteNoise?

WriteNoise has many applications. From steganography to artistic musical representation, it's truly versatile.

Since this is a lossless conversion of information, You can use the produced image as an encrypted message, that has to benefit of extra protection as people wouldn't even realize it's a message. 

Additionally, the produced image can be used a "QR code" for sound. Without an internet connection, a QR code is often only a text string. Our image can let sound be played without an internet connection.
